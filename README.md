# ruby_scripts
A few examples of my Ruby code
* fizbuz.rb # A typical interview exercise.  I did this in my spare time to test my skill with ruby.  I did not cheat, but did stumble across a key element, modulo.  Lacking formal math training, I was unaware of this function.  Using it made the script much easier.  It was still necessary to understand the embedding of a nested-if statement within a while loop.

* user_create.rb # This script is designed to install user accounts on existing instances in EC2.  I chose Ruby over Bash because I wanted to store the account data in a structured way.  In this case I used an array of hashes.

* ex3{4..6}.rb # These are exersizes I've completed from the book "Learn Ruby the Hard Way" by Zed Shaw.
